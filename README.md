Introduction to GitHub UI by use of "Hello World" project

Hello,

I am in process of changing career paths from the insurance industry into computer software and network security. My wishes are to achieve the ability to support myself in skills I have explored as a hobbyist working in this industry, even after all the reports of offshoring recently exposed. It has taken a few decades to finally admit that I should pursue skills I find enjoyable professionally, because if I'm going to have to suffer I'd rather suffer doing something I chose and appreciate. 

Working in insurance had opened my eyes to the illusion of security. I've been exposed to other's regret more often than I am comfortable with, and aim to not fall into a similar path expressed to me by these very people. 

So, to help along in my journey I seek guidence in this platform, GitHub, with its community to grow towards this goal. 

In short, "Hello World!"
